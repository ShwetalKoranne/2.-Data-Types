# 2.-Data-Types

EXPERIMENT-2:- Aim: To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).

Apparatus: VS Code or Programiz online compiler

Theory: This program illustrates the use of different basic data types in C++: int, float, char, double, string, and bool. It accepts user inputs for each type, displays the entered values, and shows their memory sizes using the sizeof() operator.

int: Stores whole numbers without decimals. Usually takes 4 bytes.
float: Stores decimal numbers with single precision. Takes about 4 bytes.
double: Stores decimal numbers with higher precision than float. Uses 8 bytes.
char: Stores a single character. Occupies 1 byte.
string: Stores a sequence of characters (text). Size varies depending on length.
bool: Stores true or false values. Uses 1 byte.
->The program first takes an integer input and displays its value and size in bytes. ->Then it accepts a float value (decimal number) and prints its value and size. ->Next, it takes a character input and shows its value and size. ->It then accepts a double value, which has higher precision than float, and displays its details. ->A string input is then taken and displayed, along with its size (note: sizeof returns the object size, not string length). ->Finally, it takes a boolean value (0 or 1) and shows its value and memory size.

Conclusion: Hence, we were able to understand about various data types in C++ and the memory size they occupy.
